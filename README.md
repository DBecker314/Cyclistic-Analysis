# Cyclistic Analysis

### Overview

This project is based on a fictional scenario at the bike-sharing company Cyclistic.  The goal of this project is to make data-driven, marketing recommendations in order to convert casual customers into annual subscribers.

### Results

The following recommendations were made based on the conclusions below and the charts [HERE](https://public.tableau.com/views/CourseraCapstoneTableau/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link):
- Increase marketing efforts towards casual riders during the spring and summer months
- Increase marketing efforts towards casual riders during weekends
- Add seasonal and weekend passes
- Add discount for members for longer trip durations on weekends

The map below displays bike-sharing stations where the size and shade of each circle represent key data from each station.  Larger circles means more total trips to and from the station, and darker circles means longer trips to and from the station.  This data could be used to determine the most cost-effective places to advertise membership opportunities.
